# Dijkstra -- Path finder

This project is an implementation of Dijkstra algorithm which is used to find the shortest path from given source to destination. The project represents a metro stations where,

- User selects source and dest stations
- He can choose time, cost or distance as priority

The algorithm lists out the paths for selected stations.
